## 📖 Overview

**Rifq** (derived from the Arabic *رِفق*, meaning *gentleness, compassion, and tender care*) is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to simplify care coordination among family members caring for elderly relatives. 

Caring for an aging parent or loved one often involves multiple siblings and family members juggling shifts, medication schedules, and clinical appointments. **Rifq** eliminates communication gaps, prevents missed doses, and ensures continuous, 24/7 care through seamless scheduling, real-time activity logs, and an intelligent context-aware healthcare assistant named **Sanad (سَنَد)**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏠 1. Care Overview & Live Activity Feed
- **At-a-Glance Status:** Instantly see who is receiving care (e.g., *Robert Johnson*) and which family caregiver is currently on duty.
- **Chronological Timeline:** Live stream of daily events including blood pressure readings, blood glucose checks, meals, afternoon walks, and completed medication rounds.

### 📅 2. 24/7 Care Schedule & Shift Swapping
- **Interactive Calendar:** Intuitive weekly strip calendar with day selection and dot coverage indicators.
- **Round-the-Clock Shifts:** Distinct shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Night) displaying caregiver name, relationship, duty summary, and direct contact action.
- **Emergency Shift Swap:** Caregivers can request shift exchanges or coverage requests with relatives directly in-app, notifying family members instantly.

### 💊 3. Medication & Appointment Management
- **Segmented Tasks:** Filter between **All**, **Pills**, and **Visits** via Material 3 segmented controls.
- **Pill Tracker:** Dosage specifications, tablet quantities, scheduled intake times, and accountability confirmation (who marked the pill as taken).
- **Medical Visits:** Scheduled appointments with specialist doctors, clinic dates, times, and handled confirmations.
- **Quick-Add Dialogs:** Beautiful, responsive Material 3 dialogs with inline validation to record new prescriptions and appointments.

### 🤖 4. "Sanad" (سَنَد) AI Healthcare Assistant
- **Context-Grounded Assistance:** Powered by **Azure OpenAI** (`gpt-4.1-mini`), Sanad is equipped with the patient's actual medication list and scheduled doctor appointments.
- **Safe & Hallucination-Resistant:** Constrained to provide helpful information exclusively based on verified patient records and medication schedules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (`^3.13.3` or higher)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with Android SDK & JDK 17
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project
- An [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/) resource deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamRifq/Rifq.git
cd Rifq/rifq
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `rifq/` directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your credentials to `.env`:

```ini
# Azure OpenAI Credentials
AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1/responses
AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
AZURE_AI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini

# Supabase Credentials
SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Never commit the `.env` file containing production secrets to public version control. It is already added to `.gitignore`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
flutter run
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflows

The repository uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and release delivery:

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **[Flutter Build](.github/workflows/build.yml)** | `push` to `main` | Validates dependencies and verifies that the release APK compiles cleanly without errors. |
| **[Publish](.github/workflows/publish.yml)** | `workflow_dispatch` (Manual) | Builds the production release APK with GitHub Secrets injected into `.env` and publishes the downloadable artifact (`app-release.apk`). |

### Setting Up GitHub Actions Secrets

To run the `publish` workflow, add the following secrets under **Repository Settings ➔ Secrets and variables ➔ Actions**:
- `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_AI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
